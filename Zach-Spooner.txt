Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        A: It sets on its own layer seperate from everything else. It doesn't exist on normal document layout.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        A:

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

        B: <img> and <span> are display inline by default.
        C: <button> is an element that is inline-block by default.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        A: The box model is the rule set that determines how a CSS element's sizes are calculated as you add padding, borders, and margins around the content.
        B: The problem with the model is that it takes element dimensions you've created and puts padding and borders on top. You have to do some adjustment math to make up for the padding and borders.
        C: The fix for the box-model is called box-sizing: border-box. This includes padding and borders in the element's width.
